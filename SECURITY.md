# Security Policy

At NNOS Device Simulator, we prioritize the security of our users and their devices. We are committed to identifying and resolving any potential security vulnerabilities to ensure a safe and secure environment for our application.

## Supported Versions

We actively support the latest stable release of our application and continuously work to address vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Below is a list of supported versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.0   | :x:                |
| 0.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |

We recommend that users always update to the latest version to benefit from the latest security improvements and patches. Versions not listed as supported will not receive security updates or fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability or any issue that could compromise the security of the application, we encourage responsible disclosure. You can report the vulnerability by following these guidelines:

1. **Contact us via email**: Send a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any related code snippets or logs (if available) to:  
   **info@nathannetwork.com**

2. **Provide clear details**: Include as much information as possible about the nature of the vulnerability, including any proof of concept or reproduction steps.

3. **Stay confidential**: We request that reporters keep vulnerabilities confidential until we have had sufficient time to investigate and release a fix.

4. **Response time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours and will work diligently to verify and address the issue as quickly as possible.

## Response and Fix

Once a vulnerability is reported, we follow a structured process:

1. **Initial assessment**: Our team will investigate and validate the reported issue to assess its impact and severity.
   
2. **Fix development**: If the issue is confirmed, we will prioritize the development of a fix or patch. We will provide a timeline for the fix based on the severity and complexity of the vulnerability.

3. **Patch release**: After resolving the issue, we will release an updated version of the application with the necessary security fixes. Users will be notified to update to the latest version.

4. **Acknowledgment**: We will credit the reporter (if desired) in our release notes or security advisories for their responsible disclosure.

## Commitment to Security

We are committed to maintaining a secure platform and appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us achieve this. Our goal is to foster a collaborative approach to security and work closely with reporters to address any issues swiftly.

If you have any questions or require clarification regarding our security policy, please feel free to reach out to us at **info@nathannetwork.com**. We value your input and thank you for helping us maintain a secure platform for all users.
